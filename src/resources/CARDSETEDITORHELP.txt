4.	GENERAL
===========

The card set editor allows the user to create and edit text files for the
AsianFlashCard application. When first invoked, the editor will come up
with an empty card set. The user can open existing card sets, add cards,
delete cards, and edit the contents of cards. Finally, the user can save
card sets to files.

Currently, the card set editor does not implement decoration of text (such
as bold, italics, underline, etc.). However, these features can be added to
text by using HTML tags (i.e., <B>some bolded text</B> to add bolds). In
addition, the user can use HTML tags to insert images and other HTML content
into cards, although the editor does not display this content, but merely
displays the HTML code.


5.	NAVIGATION
==============

In addition to the menu bar (which will be detailed below), the dialog for the
card set editor consists of the following components:

Card Set File Name

	Contains the name of the file which has been opened and to which changes will
	be saved with the Save menu command. This can be changed by opening a new file
	or by saving the card set to a different file with the menu Save As command.

Card ID

	This field indicates the card in the set being edited. It reads "Card #n of m"
	where "n" is the number of the card being displayed and "m" is the number of
	cards in the card set being edited.

< Prev. Card

	Clicking this button displays the previous card in the card set. It is disabled when
	the first card is being displayed.
	
Next Card >

	Clicking this button displays the next card in the card set. It is disabled when the
	last card is being displayed.
	
New Card

	Clicking this button creates a new card at the end of the card set and displays that
	new card.

Delete Card

	Clicking this button deletes a card from the set. A dialog is brought up asking the user
	to confirm that they want to delete the card. Clicking "Yes" deletes the card; clicking
	"No" does not delete the card. Note that it is not possible to delete the only card in
	the card set.
	
Each of the three card sides has a separate editing panel. These each have the following
fields:

Side X Title

	Contains the title of the card side. This is a editable text field and can be changed
	as needed. Note that the title applies to ALL cards in the card set; it is not changeable
	on a per-card basis.

Side X Font

	Contains the font to be used for the card side. This is a combo box containing all of
	the fonts that the program could find on the system. Note that the font applies to ALL
	cards in the card set; it is not changeable on a per-card basis. However, it is possible
	to change the font of the side of an individual card by using the HTML <FONT></FONT> tags.

Side X Font Size

	Contains the size of the font used for the card side. This is a combo box containing all
	of the font sizes available. Note that the font size applies to ALL cards in the card set;
	it is not changeable on a per-card basis. However, it is possible to change the font size
	of the side of an individual card side by using the HTML <FONT></FONT> tags.
	
Side X Text

	This field is where the user can enter or edit the text associated with the side of the
	card being displayed. Text can contain embedded HTML tags to change the decoration, add
	images, etc. One important thing to note is that carraige returns are not honored by
	the editor. If a new line is required in the card text, it must be done using the <BR/>
	tag from HTML.
	

6.	MENU ITEMS
==============

File -> New

	Create a new, blank card set for editing. If there are unsaved changes from the current
	card set, the tool will show a dialog to alert the user to this fact and ask if the
	unsaved changes should be saved or not. Clicking "Yes" will save the changes; clicking
	"No" will discard the changes; clicking "Cancel" will cancel the new card set operation.
	
File -> Open

	Open an existing card set for editing. If there are unsaved changes from the current
	card set, the tool will show a dialog to alert the user to this fact and ask if the
	unsaved changes should be saved or not. Clicking "Yes" will save the changes; clicking
	"No" will discard the changes; clicking "Cancel" will cancel the open card set operation.
	Note that it is possible to open multiple card set files. However, the cards from those
	card set files will be merged into a single card set, which should be saved in its own
	file. When multiple card set files are opened, the tool does not set up the file into
	which the card set will be saved.

File -> Close

	Close the open card set. If there are unsaved changes from the current card set, the tool
	will show a dialog to alert the user to this fact and ask if the unsaved changes should be
	saved or not. Clicking "Yes" will save the changes; clicking "No" will discard the changes;
	clicking "Cancel" will cancel the close card set operation.

File -> Save

	Save any unsaved changes to the card set in the file specified for the card set. If there
	is no file for the card set, the program will bring up a dialog to ask the user for the
	file name. Clicking "Save" in this dialog saves the cards in the specified file; clicking
	"Cancel" cancels the save operation. By default, card sets for this tool are saved in files
	with the ".alfc" extension.
	
File -> Save As

	Asks the user for the name of a card set file into which to save the current card set. Clicking
	"Save" in this dialog saves the cards in the specified file; clicking "Cancel" cancels the save
	operation. By default, card sets for this tool are saved in files with the ".alfc" extension.
	
File -> Quit Card Editor

	Quits the card editor tool, but leaves the AsianFlashCard application running. If there are
	unsaved changes from the current card set, the tool will show a dialog to alert the user to
	this fact and ask if the unsaved changes should be saved or not. Clicking "Yes" will save the
	changes; clicking "No" will discard the changes; clicking "Cancel" will cancel the quit editor
	operation.

File -> Quit AsianFlashCard

	Quits both the card editor tool and the AsianFlashCard application. If there are
	unsaved changes from the current card set, the tool will show a dialog to alert the user to
	this fact and ask if the unsaved changes should be saved or not. Clicking "Yes" will save the
	changes; clicking "No" will discard the changes; clicking "Cancel" will cancel the quit
	operation.
